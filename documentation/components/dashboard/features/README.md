# Features In-Depth

This area is intended to shed some light on how Dashboard features work. We don't typically have a lot of features that do not rely on some backend team, but for those that we do, questions are often asked about "how do they work".

It is worth noting, some of this information will talk about other backend features when appropriate. This will not be an in-depth knowledge on how _those_ features work. Just how Dashboard interacts with them.

## Features

1. [Data Connections - Connection Types - Connections](./connections.md)
